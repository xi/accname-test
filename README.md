# accname-test

This is a collection of test cases for the [Accessible Name and Description
Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/). It is just a bunch of
HTML files. Feel free to use these in your tests.

You can also use [babelacc](https://xi.github.io/babelacc/) to find new test
cases.
